Theses from my academic career.\
\
-L'effetto Schwinger, my undergraduate thesis, is about the Schwinger effect, first hypothesised by Sauter, and later quantitatively computed by Schwinger in the seminal paper --->https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.82.664\
in line with the effective field description of the electromagnetic interaction first proposed by Euler, Cockel and Heisenberg while describing "light-by-light" scattering\
\
-No title, but my Master's degree thesis about the one-loop effective action of a Dirac field non-minimally coupled to gravity with torsion, in a more general framework of General Relativity.
