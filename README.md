Theses from my academic career.\
\
-On the renormalization of Dirac fields in Metric-Affine and Teleparallel Gravity, my Master's degree thesis, is a study of the quantum effective actions of a Dirac field non-minimally coupled to a general model of gravity, finalized to the comparison between General Relativity and Teleparallel Gravity at quantum level. My result shows that although dynamically equivalent at classical level, these theories do not share the same properties once quantum fields are introduced into the picture.
\
-L'effetto Schwinger, my undergraduate thesis, is about the Schwinger effect, first hypothesised by Sauter, and later quantitatively computed by Schwinger in the seminal paper --->https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.82.664\
in line with the effective field description of the electromagnetic interaction first proposed by Euler, Cockel and Heisenberg while describing "light-by-light" scattering.
